  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>1 ½ cups chocolate cookie crumbs</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
    <li>To make the crust: Mix 1 1/2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar together in a small bowl until well combined; press onto the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; allow to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To make the filling: Heat 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup chocolate chips in a small saucepan, stirring constantly, until chips are melted. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat cream cheese and 1 cup of sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add cocoa and beat well. Add eggs and beat on low until just blended. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and melted chocolate-cream mixture until blended; pour filling over crust.</li>
    <li>Bake cheesecake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 45 to 50 minutes. Run the tip of a table knife around the edges of the pan, set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature.</li>
    <li>To make the chocolate topping: Place 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Heat 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a small saucepan, stirring continuously, until just before boiling; pour hot cream over chocolate chips and stir with a spoon until smooth. Spread over baked cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.</li>
